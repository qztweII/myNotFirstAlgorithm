# myNotFirstAlgorithm
 This is a repository for my not first algorithm

## What it does
It is a text-based food ordering-style algorthm. 

First, you will choose your food, then it will tell you the total price of your order. It also saves your order into a file in the 'orders' folder. 

## Other things of note
- There is a seperate file containing the menu and the food's cost.
